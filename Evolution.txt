Alligators and caimans split in North America during the early Tertiary or late Cretaceous (about 53 million to 65 million years ago).[4][5] The Chinese alligator split from the American alligator about 33 million years ago[4] and probably descended from a lineage that crossed the Bering land bridge during the Neogene. The modern American alligator is well represented in the fossil record of the Pleistocene.[6] The alligator's full mitochondrial genome was sequenced in the 1990s.[7] The full genome, published in 2014, suggests that the alligator evolved much more slowly than mammals and birds.
